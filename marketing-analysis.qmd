# Situation

You are currently in position 3 of a paid text search keyword. The click-through rate (clicks per impressions) is 1% and the cost-per-click (CPC) is \$1. You can get into position 1 by paying \$2 CPC and would expect a CTR of 2%. In position 2, your CPC would be \$1.5 and you would expect a CTR of 1.5%. Conversion Rate (conversions per click) is 5% for all positions. (CvR) Gross margin per conversion is 20% (before advertising cost). Average Order (conversion) Value is \$200. (AOV)

The table below summarizes the above information:

| Ad Position | CTR   | CvR | Gross Margin | CPC    | AOV   |
|-------------|-------|-----|--------------|--------|-------|
| 1           | 2.00% | 5%  | 20%          | \$2.00 | \$200 |
| 2           | 1.50% | 5%  | 20%          | \$1.50 | \$200 |
| 3           | 1.00% | 5%  | 20%          | \$1.00 | \$200 |
